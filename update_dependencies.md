# Dependency Update Instructions

## What was updated

This update addresses the outdated dependencies issue mentioned in the problem statement. The following changes were made to `pubspec.yaml`:

### Test Package (Main Issue)
- `test`: ^1.25.15 → ^1.26.3

### Core Dependencies Updated
- `provider`: ^6.1.2 → ^6.1.3
- `http`: ^1.2.1 → ^1.2.2
- `dio`: ^5.4.3+1 → ^5.7.0

### Video Dependencies
- `video_player`: ^2.8.6 → ^2.9.2
- `chewie`: ^1.8.1 → ^1.8.5

### Storage Dependencies
- `sqflite`: ^2.3.3+1 → ^2.4.1
- `flutter_secure_storage`: ^9.0.0 → ^9.2.4
- `shared_preferences`: ^2.2.3 → ^2.3.3
- `path_provider`: ^2.1.3 → ^2.1.5
- `path`: ^1.9.0 → ^1.9.1

### UI Dependencies
- `cached_network_image`: ^3.3.1 → ^3.4.1

### Utility Dependencies
- `connectivity_plus`: ^6.0.3 → ^6.1.0
- `url_launcher`: ^6.2.6 → ^6.3.1

### Dev Dependencies
- `build_runner`: ^2.6.0 → ^2.6.1

## Next Steps

To complete the dependency update process, run the following commands:

```bash
# Remove the old pubspec.lock file
rm pubspec.lock

# Get the updated dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify no issues remain
flutter pub outdated

# Run tests to ensure everything still works
flutter test

# Build the app to ensure no build issues
flutter build apk --debug
```

## Expected Results

After running `flutter pub get`, you should see:
1. All transitive dependencies updated to their latest versions
2. The discontinued `js` package should be replaced with newer implementations that use `dart:js_interop`
3. No more warnings about discontinued packages
4. All packages updated to their latest available versions

## Why these changes resolve the issues

1. **Test package**: Direct update from 1.25.15 to 1.26.3 as requested
2. **Discontinued js package**: The `js` package was a transitive dependency pulled in by web implementations of packages like `video_player`, `url_launcher`, `shared_preferences`, etc. Updating these packages to their latest versions ensures they use the newer `dart:js_interop` instead of the deprecated `js` package.
3. **Other transitive dependencies**: Will be automatically updated when the direct dependencies are updated.

The update strategy focused on updating the direct dependencies that commonly cause transitive dependency issues, which should resolve the majority of the outdated packages mentioned in the original issue.
